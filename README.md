Hello folks!<br/>
Here is my small attempt for replicating the profile page of any random handle of Instagram.<br/>
It uses technologies like <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong><br/>
This task gave me exposure to clearing concepts like html box model, element positioning, applying css attributes and styling.<br/>
If you want to add dynamicity to the existing webpage, feel free and go all out with your knowledge and creativity!<br/>
<h2>Happy Coding<h2></h2>
